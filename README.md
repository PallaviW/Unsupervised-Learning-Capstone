# Unsupervised-Learning-Capstone : Analysis of The 20 newsgroups text dataset

## PURPOSE

- This project analyzes 20 newsgroups datasets, which comprises around 18, 000 newsgroups posts on 20 topics split into two subsets: one for training (or development) and the other one for testing (or for performance evaluation). 
- The objective is to do analysis using supervised as well as unsupervised learning models like Gradient Boost, Logistic Regression, SVM, KNN, K-Means.
